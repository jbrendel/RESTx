    <h3>DatabaseAccess: A use case for specialized components</h3>
    <p>The DatabaseAccess component implements access to an SQL database. To set up
    database access, important, security sensitive or quite technical information needs
    to be provided as configuration. For example, the database name, the JDBC driver
    class or the connection string.</p>

    <h3>Using specialized components to pre-configure and hide fields</h3>

    <p>Often it is NOT desirable to share this information. At the same time, we want
    to enable users of the system to create their own RESTful web services and resources
    based on the database access we configure for them.</p>

    <p>To facilitate this, RESTx uses the concept of "specialized components". In effect,
    these are partially configured resources. For example, the IT staff could create
    specialized component, based on the DatabaseAccess component: Only the DB connection string
    and other critical information is provided. This is then stored as a new 'specialized
    component'. Users then can create new resources based on this specialized component:
    They still can configure their own fields and where clauses, but do not have the ability
    to change the DB connection string or JDBC driver class.</p>

    <p>Let's go through an example...</p>

    <h3>The example</h3>

    <p>Below you can see that the DatabaseAccess component requires or accepts a lot of
    different parameters. Assume we are the IT staff and want to pre-configure some of the
    critical fields for our users (while at the same time hiding these fields).</p>

    <p>It starts out as usual, by clicking on the 
    <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('[ Create resource ]');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('[ Create resource ]');" class="lref">Create resource</span> link.</p>
</td>
<td valign=top>
    <h3>Next:</h3>
    <p>Let's create a specialized component, which pre-configures many important fields for
    database access. To create a specialized component, we start by clicking on the
    <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('[ Create resource ]');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('[ Create resource ]');" class="lref">Create resource</span> link.</p>
</td>
