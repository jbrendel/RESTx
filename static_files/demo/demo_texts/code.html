    <h3>List of available components</h3>
    <p>Here you see the list of all the available components. For each component, a small
    human-readable description is displayed, as well as a link to more information about that
    particular component.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a component?</h3>
    <p>A component is a piece of stand-alone software, which performs a very specific function, such
    as accessing a database, a cloud service, a proprietary in-house API, etc. Components can also take
    advantage of RESTx and implement even complex data integration logic in just a few lines
    of code.</p>
    
    <p>Serious data integration work often requires custom code at some point. That is why RESTx
    puts a lot of emphasis on making the writing of custom components as quick and easy as possible.
    You even have a choice of languages for your own components: You can write them
    either in <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/documented-java-component-example" target="_blank">Java</a>,
    <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/documented-python-component-example" target="_blank">Python</a> or server-side
    <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/documented-javascript-component-example" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>.</p>

    <p>The component API is very small and easy to learn. RESTx comes with command line utilities that create a
    ready-to-use component template in the language of your choice. You just need to fill in the blanks.

    <h3>Next:</h3>
    <p>Let's take a look at two components in more detail. Follow these two examples in order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the
            <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/code/GsearchComponent');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/code/GsearchComponent');" class="lref">/code/GsearchComponent</span>
            link. The 'GsearchComponent' implements access to Google's search API. This illustrates creation of a basic resource from a component.</li>
        <li>Click on the
            <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/code/DatabaseAccess');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/code/DatabaseAccess');" class="lref">/code/DatabaseAccess</span>
            link. The 'DatabaseAccess' implements access to an SQL database. This illustrates the important concept of specialized components.</li>
    </ol>
