    <h3>A new RESTful resource, ready to use</h3>
    <p>Just like RESTx showed us meta data about components, it also shows similar
    information about a resource. At first glance this looks quite similar. However,
    please notice that the parameters you provided during resource creation time are
    not shown anymore. This makes perfect sense, since users of the new resource
    do not have to concern themselves with the technical details of what's behind
    that resource.</p>

    <p>As before, you can see a 
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('desc');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('desc');" class="lref">description</span> and the
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('name');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('name');" class="lref">name</span> of the resource.
    </p>

    <p>Below that you can see the description of the available
    <span onmouseover="rowHighlight('services');" onmouseout="stopRowHighlight('services');" class="lref">services</span> again, with
    all the usual details, including description of input and output types as well as parameters. That way, a client has all the
    information they need in order to use the services (or sub-resources) provided by this resouce.</p>

    <p>Finally, as part of the service description, we get a
    <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/resource/restx_search_results/search');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/resource/restx_search_results/search');" class="lref">link</span>
    which when clicked invokes the service method of the component, which implements this sub-resource.</p>

    <h3>Next:</h3>
    <p>Click on the 
    <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/resource/restx_search_results/search');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/resource/restx_search_results/search');" class="lref">link
    for the search sub-resource</span>. Please note: This will trigger a Google search, so it may take a few seconds to see the results.</p>
