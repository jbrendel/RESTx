    <h3>List of available resources</h3>
    <p>Here you see the list of all currently available resources. A
    human-readable description is displayed, as well as a link to more information about that
    particular resource.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a resource?</h3>
    <p>A resource is a something that can be directly used, without requiring any
    further knowledge. Usually, it provides a link that can just be clicked on to get some
    data. Often, it is also possible to perform updates to the underlying data, using nothing
    but ordinary web requests to send the information.</p>

    <p>A resource is created by providing a set of parameters for the components, which are
    specialized, generic pieces of code living in the RESTx server, which implement
    a very specific function, such as accessing a database, a cloud service, a proprietary
    in-house API, etc. Components can also take
    advantage of RESTx and implement even complex data integration logic in just a few lines
    of code.</p>

    <p>Once these parameters are provided, RESTx stores them for later use and creates the
    URL of a new resource. Once that URL is accessed, the parameters are loaded again and
    applied to the component.</p>

    <p>You can now return 
       <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('Home');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('Home');" class="lref">Home</span> and
       see yourself how easy it is to create new RESTful web services and resources with RESTx.</p>

    <p>Please return to the server's home page by clicking the
       <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('Home');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('Home');" class="lref">Home</span> link.
