    <h2>Welcome to the RESTx demo: The server's home page</h2>
    <h3>RESTful API</h3>
    <p>RESTx provides a fully RESTful API. Everything the server has to offer can
    be explored simply by following links. The server's root URI is the only URI a client
    needs to know. Since we just accessed the root URI you can see links
    to other parts of the RESTx server, which we will explore shortly. 
    To find out more about RESTx's RESTful API, please
    <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/restful-server-api" target="_blank">click here</a> (opens in new window).</p>

    <h3>Content negotiation</h3>
    <p>RESTx supports content negotiation: The same information can be returned in
    different representations, depending on the client's preferences. Right now, RESTx has recognized
    that it is accessed via browser, this all information is rendered in useful HTML.</p>

    <p>However, if you specify <code>Accept: application/json</code> as one of
    the HTTP request headers you see the same information rendered in plain
    JSON. To see and example of this, please
    <a href="http://restx.mulesoft.org/restful-server-api" target="_blank">click here</a> (opens in new window).</p>

    <h3>Next:</h3>
    <p>Do these two steps in order:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>See what happens if you follow one of those links. For example, you could take a look at the server's
            built-in documentation. To do so, in the frame below click on the link labelled
            <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/meta/doc');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/meta/doc');" class="lref">/meta/doc</span>
            (hover here to have that link highlighted).</li>
        <li>Let us now take a look at the components, which are currently installed in this RESTx server.
            In the frame below, please click on the link labelled <span onmouseover="linkHighlight('/code');" onmouseout="stopLinkHighlight('/code');" class="lref">/code</span>
            (hover here to have that link highlighted).</li>
    </ol>
