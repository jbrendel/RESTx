We have here a directory for each of the languages that
are supported by the component API. Under each of those
language specific directories there is a 'src' directory.
Within the 'src' directory there is a 'SampleComponent'
written in that particular language.

The sub-directory layout within the 'src' directory
reflects where into the $RESTX_HOME/src directory a new
component for this language needs to be installed.
